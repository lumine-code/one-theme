# one-theme

The One day and night UI and syntax themes.

Fork of [pulsar-edit/pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar) (`packages/one-dark-ui`, `packages/one-light-ui`, `packages/one-dark-syntax`, `packages/one-light-syntax`).

## Features

- **Four themes**: provides `one-day-ui`, `one-day-syntax`, `one-night-ui`, and `one-night-syntax` as independently selectable themes.
- **CSS custom properties**: each theme defines its palette as CSS custom properties in a `variables.css`, the source of truth for the theme variable contract.
- **Shared syntax rules**: both syntax themes load the same scope-to-color stylesheets, so day and night differ only in their palettes.
- **Mix and match**: any theme can be paired with a community counterpart, e.g. `one-night-ui` with a third-party syntax theme.
- **Reusable foundation**: other bundled themes can load the shared UI or syntax styles first and keep only their overrides locally.

## Installation

To install `one-theme` search for it in the Install pane of the Lumine settings, or run the command `lumine --install lumine-code/one-theme`.

## Theme pack

The package declares its four themes as the **One** pack. Use `theme-selector:toggle` to preview and select it.

## Derived themes

A multi-theme entry can load a package-relative style directory before its own styles:

```json
{
  "name": "example-day-ui",
  "theme": "ui",
  "extends": ["one-theme::styles/ui/*"],
  "styles": ["styles/ui-overrides", "styles/day-ui"]
}
```

`extends` accepts one `package-name::glob` string or an ordered list of them. Matches from each glob are sorted, then loaded in list order, followed by the entry's `styles` directories. This is ordinary CSS cascade order: the derived theme keeps only the declarations it needs to override. Extending styles does not activate the referenced package's JavaScript or add its theme class.
